The project aims at classifying images as different classes of legos using a pre-trained model in keras, VGG16.
The notebook is organised as follows:

1. Data exploration
2. Train and validation split
3. Training image generation in batches using Data generator
4. Visualization
5. Training a VGG16 model
6. Evaluating model accuracy and loss
